# Project about recipes🥓
It's a application for search recipes 🥧🎂🍔🥓 you can sort by type of diet 🎯, healthy level 🥬, score 🎱, and more. Also you can create your own recipe for yourself an you can put your instructions of your recipe 🥂!

# What you need to see it 🍭
First of all yo need to install Node.JS and a code editor like Visual Studio Code. Run the command "npm install" on your console in the folder called api and the same instruction in the folder client.

What you need to do to see this project is 🔍:

Create a .env file in the main folder with your database in PostgreSQL like this:

DB_USER="your user"
DB_PASSWORD="your password"
DB_HOST=localhost
API_KEY="your api key" (here, what you need to do is create an account and  copy the api key from spoonacular api (https://spoonacular.com/food-api) 😿).

And that's all you will avaliable to see it and try it. If you cannot let me know 🙀.
